## About
This repository `iopa` is an API-first, Internet of Things (IoT) stack for Node.js. 
It is the official implementation of the Internet of Protocols Alliance (IOPA) reference pattern

It is open-source, drop-in replacement for legacy stacks based on Connect, Express, and Koa, with built-in seamless bridging to Node's built-in HTTP server,
but the real power comes from creating a common pattern for IoT devices that seamless run as COAP servers using [`iopa-coap`](https://github.com/iopa-io/iopa-coap), 
MQTT brokers/clients using [`iopa-coap`](https://github.com/iopa-io/iopa-mqtt), and even native mobile and desktop applications using [nodekit.io](https://github.com/limerun/nodekit)

## Target Audience
This repository is primarily geared at application developers and device developers who want to connect their products to the Internet of Things, but don't want
to be tied down to any one protocol or standard (be it hardware or software based).  Further, they want to have a simple "all data flows one way" approach to
developing applications or device logic, with a fabric that encourages good programming patterns and discourages anti-patterns.  They don't want to reinvent the
wheel and therefore want all boilerplate and common logic for implementing a server to be simple use statements:

### Pseudo-code

 ``` js
// DEFINE TRANSPORT LAYERS
app.use(tcp);
app.use(udp);
app.use(websockets);

// ADD SECURITY LAYERS
app.use(tls);
app.use(cors);

// DEFINE PROTOCOL LAYERS
app.use(mqtt);
app.use(coap);

// ADD APPLICATION LOGIC
app.mount('/device/lightswitch', function(context, next){
  if (context[IOPA.Method] = "ON")
      this.lightswitch.turnon;
});
```

## Pattern, Standards, Fabrics and Frameworks.

[IOPA](https://github.com/iopa-io/iopa-spec) is neither a protocol STANDARD nor a FRAMEWORK. Rather it is a PATTERN that defines a well-defined API (by convention not reference)
between the broadest scope of Internet of Things (IoT) transport layers and application/device logic.  The reference implementation is a fabric that speeds development of applications
that use the pattern, but is not necessary to implement or to interoperate with any other application, or middleware micro-service -- it just provides some very handy reference classes and 
constants for intellisense development, and provides a robust, tested example of the most common logic required (a dispatcher called the AppBuilder class, and a factory for creating
IOPA context with automatic scope tracking). 

IOPA is a loose port of the [OWIN](http://owin.org) specification to expand the reach to Node.js servers but is language independent.  The pattern works for 
Node.js javascript (including V4.0+),  browser-side javascript, Swift V2., Objective-C and Golang.   The reference implementation is written in javascript for Node.js 4.x.

Published as open-source without dependence on any implementation or platform, the IOPA specs allow applications to be developed independently of the actual server (nGinX, IIS, Node.js, Katana, node-coap, iopa-mqtt, iopa-coap, iopa-http, etc.). 
Because it is a well-defined pattern that uses only base language features it is not even necessary to include this repository in any microservices that rely on it.  The entire
pattern works using well-known string constants (published in the open-source [IOPA](https://github.com/iopa-io/iopa-spec) specification).  However, inclusion of this repository gives access to intellisense, constant optimization, etc.

In contrast to the [IOPA](https://github.com/iopa-io/iopa-spec) *specification*, this repository contains an **actual** IOPA reference **implementation** for node.js Javascript.  

A broad ecosystem of servers and middleware, such as routers and view engines, exist in the the [iopa-io](https://github.com/iopa-io] and [limerun](https://github.com/limerun] organizations on GitHub.


## Core Principles

An `IOPA` middleware/application is simply a `function(context, next)` that we call an "AppFunc" that provides a single REST-like IOPA context for each request, where it is easy to access all the HTTP/COAP parameters  (`context.path`, `context.response.body` etc.).  "Tasks" (promises) are returned for full async programming without callback hell, and for full compatibility with the upcoming ES7 async/await functionality.

Middleware can be chained with `app.use(middleware1).use(middleware2)` etc.

With the [`iopa-connect`](https://github.com/iopa-io/iopa-connect) package, `IOPA` servers can also call legacy Node HTTP middleware in the same chain with `app.use( function(req,res){ ... }  )`. 

`IOPA` middleware and legacy middleware can be used with a COAP server such as [node-coap](https://github.com/mcollina/node-coap) with `app.buildCoap()` and can be used directly with Node's built-in http server with `app.buildHttp()` when used with the [`iopa-connect`](https://github.com/iopa-io/iopa-connect) package.    It can even be used in embedded webkit applications such as [nodekit.io](https://github.com/limerun/nodekit).


## For People, Animals, Devices and Things
`iopa` powers `nodekit.io`, an open-source cross-platform IOPA certified user interface framework for Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, Node.js, etc.   Anything that can be written as a web application or REST application can be run on a single device with no coding changes, in javascript.      As such IOPA is for communicating with people, animals, devices and things.

`iopa` also powers `limerun`, a cross-platform IOPA connected IoT framework for any device that runs Node.js (including Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, etc. ).  As such iopa is for communicating things.


## NPM Package Contents

This repository contains a Node Package Manager (NPM) package with helper functions for:
 
* IOPA constants for commonly used properties
* AppBuilder dispatcher for chaining middleware and applications, with automatic bridging to async-based Tasks (Promises), use of *this* for IopaContext instead of separate argument, and *next* argument for middleware chaining
* Context factory for creating your own IOPA contexts (typically used by a server)

This package is intended for use in Node.js applications that either run on a web server that conform to the IOPA specifications (such as the embedded webserver inside [nodekit.io](https://github.com/nodekit-io/nodekit)) or run using the iopa-coap, iopa-mqtt, and iopa-http bridges when used with those respective packages.

## Middleware/Application Pipeline Creator and Dispatcher: AppBuilder 
```js
app.use(middleware)
```

Adds a middleware node to the IOPA function pipeline. The middleware are
invoked in the order they are added: the first middleware passed to `app.use` will
be the outermost function, and the last middleware passed to Use will be the
innermost.

### middleware
The middleware parameter determines which behavior is being chained into the pipeline. 

* If the middleware given to use is a function that takes **one** argument, then it will be invoked with the `next` component in the chain as its parameter, and with the `this` context set to the IOPA context.  It MUST return a promise that conforms to the Promise/A specification.

* If the middleware given to use is a function that takes **two** arguments, then it will be invoked with the `next` component in the chain as its parameter, with a Node-based callback (`function(err, result){}`)as its second parameter, and with the `this` context set to the IOPA context.  This type of middleware should return void.

* Legacy middleware can also be invoked with  `app.use( function(req,res){ ... }  )`, `app.use( function(req, res, next){ ... }  )` or `app.use( function(err, req, res, next){ ... }  )`.  The AppBuilder is smart enough to detect the two argument function with parameters named req and res in this case (use of different naming conventions need to be wrapped in a `function(req,res){}`), and assumes three and four argument functions are legacy.


### returns app
The AppBuilder `app` itself is returned. This enables you to chain your use statements together.

### build pipeline when all middleware added:
```js
app.build()
```
returns an IOPA AppFunc `(promise) function(context)` that can be inserted into any IOPA server.


## Example Usage

### Installation
``` js
npm install iopa
```
 
### Basic Example
``` js
const iopa = require('iopa')

var app = new iopa.App();
app.use(function (context, next) {
  context.log.info("HELLO WORLD" + context.toString());
  return Promise.resolve(null);
});

var demo = app.build();

var context = (new iopa.Factory()).createContext();    // typically done within a TCP or UDP server

context.using(demo);     // the using automatically disposes of the context (returning it to a pool) when demo AppFunc is complete

```
   
### Automatic Connect Bridge to Legacy Connect/Express Middleware and Node HTTP Server  
``` js
var iopa = require('iopa')
  , http = require('http')
  , iopaConnect = require('iopa-connect')
  
var app = new iopa.App();
app.use(iopaConnect);
app.use(function(req, res) {
    response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
    response.end("<html><head></head><body>Hello World</body>");
});
http.createServer(app.buildHttp()).listen(); 
```    

### IOPA - HTTP Bridge Only with IOPA Promise based middleware
    
``` js
var iopa = require('iopa'),
    http = require('http'),
    iopaConnect = require('iopa-connect');

var app = new iopa.App();
app.use(iopaConnect);
app.use(function(next){
    this.response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
    this.response.end("<html><head></head><body>Hello World</body>");
    return next();
});
http.createServer(app.buildHttp()).listen();
```  

## Definitions

 * **appFunc** = `(Promise) function(context)` 
 * **app.use** = `(app)function(middleware)`
 * **middleware** = `(Promise) function(context, next)` with `next`=**appFunc**
 * OR **middleware** = `fn(req, res, next)` for compatibility with Connect/ExpressJS middleware
 * OR **middleware** = `fn(err, req, res, next)` for compatibility with Connect/ExpressJS middleware
 * **app.build** = `(appFunc) function(context)`   // builds middleware 
 * **app.buildHttp** = `(function(req, res)) function()`   // builds middleware for compatibility with Connect/ExpressJS hosts
 * **context** = IOPA context dictionary
